In this project, an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) system is proposed which is in operation as transparent as the digital system. The Simplified Electronic Voting Machine (SEVM) responds on some flow of pulses coming from the switch operated by voter and produces the output of the counting values i.e. total casting votes of individual nominee and displays it. The machine is controlled both automatically and manually to operate the system for successive voters and to ensure that a voter can give only one vote to his/her chosen candidate of the same position

Designed and implemented an electronic voting machine system that on the positive edge of the clock, checks if any of the buttons is pressed, if yes increases the count of votes of the candidate corresponding to the button, and blinks the LED in front of the candidate button. This entire functioning takes place only if the ballot is on. A Reset button to reset the counter of each candidate votes and a BCD to display the votes of each candidate turn by turn.

It is being depiced by the block diagram below:

We tried to keep the logic simple so that it can be easily implemented and explained out with the help of flowchart shown below:
